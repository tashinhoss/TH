                            <strong>Abstract—</strong>The upsurge of prolific blogging and microblogging platforms enabled the abusers to spread negativity 
                            and threats greater than ever. Negative and hateful comments are averting users from sharing their opinion freely on social media 
                            platforms. It often breaks people’s confidence and causes extensive damage to their mental health. Hence, identifying these 
                            toxic contents and taking appropriate measures against them is crucial to preserve a safe environment on social media. 
                            Numerous state-of-the-art approaches classify the whole content as toxic or non-toxic, but they don’t distinguish the precise 
                            toxic portion from the whole content. Detecting the toxic portions is essential as it substantially aids to moderate the toxic 
                            contents through excluding the abusive parts. This paper describes our proposed approach to detect the toxic portions from 
                            text contents efficiently and accurately. We explore an ensemble of sequence labeling models including the word embedding-based 
                            Spark NLP NER (named entity recognition) deep learning model, spaCy NER model with custom toxic tags, and ALBERT NER model 
                            to identify the toxic spans. The NER-based models usually intend to capture the contextual attributes of phrases and spans that 
                            are essential for named entity recognition. As the toxic span detection task also requires us to apprehend the phrasal context 
                            for detecting toxic span, the similarity between these two tasks inspires us to exploit these NER models. Finally, we determine the 
                            final toxic spans using a prevalence-based fusion of the predictions generated by these models. The fusion strategy enables us to 
                            consolidate the diversity of these models for perceiving the phrasal context in all aspects. Experimental results achieved on the 
                            SemEval-2021 toxic spans detection dataset depict that our model meticulously captures the toxic fragment and achieves a competitive result among the other state-of-the-art methods.

                        CSECU-DSG at WNUT-2020 Task 2: Exploiting ensemble of transfer learning and hand-crafted features for identification of informative COVID-19 English tweets

                            <strong>Abstract—</strong> COVID-19 pandemic has become the trending topic on twitter and people are interested in sharing diverse information ranging from new cases, 
                            healthcare guidelines, medicine, and vaccine news. Such information assists the people to be updated about the situation as well as 
                            beneficial for public safety personnel for decision making. However, the informal nature of twitter makes it challenging to refine 
                            the informative tweets from the huge tweet streams. To address these challenges WNUT-2020 introduced a shared task focusing on 
                            COVID-19 related informative tweet identification. In this paper, we describe our participation in this task. We propose a neural 
                            model that adopts the strength of transfer learning and hand-crafted features in a unified architecture. To extract the transfer 
                            learning features, we utilize the state-of-the-art pre-trained sentence embedding model BERT, RoBERTa, and InferSent, whereas various 
                            twitter characteristics are exploited to extract the hand-crafted features. Next, various feature combinations are utilized to train a
                             set of multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the base-classifier. Finally, a majority voting based fusion approach is employed to determine
                              the informative tweets. Our approach achieved competitive performance and outperformed the baseline by 7% (approx.).

                            <strong>Abstract—</strong> Inscribing persuasion techniques in memes is the most impactful way to influence peoples' mindsets. People are more inclined to memes as they are more stimulating and convincing and hence memes are often exploited by tactfully engraving propaganda in its context with the intent of attaining specific agenda. This paper describes our participation in the three subtasks featured by SemEval 2021 task 6 on the detection of persuasion techniques in texts and images. We utilize a fusion of logistic regression, decision tree, and fine-tuned DistilBERT for tackling subtask 1. As for subtask 2, we propose a system that consolidates a span identification model and a multi-label classification model based on pre-trained BERT. We address the multi-modal multi-label classification of memes defined in subtask 3 by utilizing a ResNet50 based image model, DistilBERT based text model, and a multi-modal architecture based on multikernel CNN+LSTM and MLP model. The outcomes illustrated the competitive performance of our systems.

                            <strong>Abstract—</strong> Automated processing of legal documents is essential to manage the enormous volume of legal corpus and to make it easily accessible to a broad spectrum of people. But due to the amorphous and variable nature of legal documents, it is very challenging to directly proceed with complicated processes such as summarization, analysis, and query. Segmenting the documents as per the rhetorical roles can aid and accelerate such procedures. This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2023 task 6: Sub-task A: Rhetorical Roles Prediction. We utilize a finetuned Legal-BERT to address this task. We also conduct an error analysis to illustrate the shortcomings of our deployed approach.

                            <strong>Abstract—</strong> Online social platforms are now propagating sexist content endangering the involvement and inclusion of women on these platforms. Sexism refers to hostility, bigotry, or discrimination based on gender, typically against women. The proliferation of such notions deters women from engaging in social media spontaneously. Hence, detecting sexist content is critical to ensure a safe online platform where women can participate without the fear of being a target of sexism. This paper describes our participation in subtask A of SemEval-2023 Task 10: Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS). This subtask requires classifying textual content as sexist or not sexist. We incorporate a RoBERTa-based architecture and further finetune the hyperparameters to entail better performance. The procured results depict the competitive performance of our approach among the other participants.
